Lulu cover:
    Size:
        Spine width: 11.03 Postscript points wide (0.153")
        Spine begins 621 Postscript points (8.63") from the left.
        Total cover width: 1253.03 X 810 Postscript points (17.40" X 11.25")
        Bleed seems to be 1/8 of an inch (0.125"), since 11.25" is .25 more than 11" high.
        8.5*2 + 0.125*2 = 17 + 0.25 = 0.15" for the spine, or about 1/8".
    Don't know what DPI to use -- 300? 600?
        Lulu recommends 300.
    Ideas:
        Helvetica font, white.
            Actually Futura would be nice!
        Gold/yellow/brown background.
            See "lulu gears" reference image.
        Interesting pattern overlaid, like plaid.
            See "lulu gears texture" reference image.
        Gears intermeshed.
        Faint source code.
        Faint edge equation.
        No text on back, just design.
