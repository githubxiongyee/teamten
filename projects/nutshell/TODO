        - Make our own crosshatcher?
            - RonJr (YouTube):
                - Invert, blur, dodge, over original, then desaturate.
    - Get condensed Garamond.
    - Get font with nicer kerning (see AW of LAWRENCE).
    - What is width of spine?
- Review "Veneer proofs" post. Kinda weak.
- Java for Everything post:
    - Has XXX at front.
    - Re-read and clean up.
- Look at order of posts.
    - Chronological?
    - Most-to-least interesting?
    - Alternate long and short?
    - End on strong post.
- Add dedication?
- Fix all the layout bugs:
    - Picking stocks article:
        - Graph.
            - Check on web page.
- Try generating the diagrams at a particular resolution (300 DPI) and
    using prince-specific CSS rules so they don't scale.
