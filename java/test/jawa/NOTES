- Expand append() in template processor.

- In template, if a {% %} line is entirely on its own line (only whitespace
  before and after), remove all whitespace and newline.
    - Keep track of whether we saw only white space on a line, and
      whether we had a statement. If yes when we get to \n, remove contents
      of line. Also keep track of position of start of line. Also do this
      at end of file?

- Inside {% %} delegate back to Jawa parser since we'll have other things
  there, possibly including other templates.
