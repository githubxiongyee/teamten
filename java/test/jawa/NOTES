- In template, if a {% %} line is entirely on its own line (only whitespace
  before and after), remove all whitespace and newline.

- Inside {% %} delegate back to Jawa parser since we'll have other things
  there, possibly including other templates.

- Test calling other function from within {% %}.

- Does it make sense to call other function from {{ }}? The function would
  have to return a string, which means our template would have to accumulate
  a string.

- Perhaps `` should return a string, not write to a writer.
    - Advantages:
        - No magic "writer" variable.
        - Perhaps faster if writer is not buffered.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Perhaps slower if have to make large strings.
        - Not good for very large outputs that have to fit in memory.
        - Must be used in an expression, so can't have statements.
