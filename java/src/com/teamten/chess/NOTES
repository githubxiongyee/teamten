- Turn the program into a server. This will allow us to:
    - Play with any UI.
    - Play different versions against each other.
- Find way to play different versions against one another.
    - Make client that connects to two servers and plays them.
    - Make infrastructure to clone new repo at two different GIT versions, compile, and run.
- Look through saved screenshots, make FEN regression tests for each.
    - Really slow end-of-game when mate is in sight. Why is it so slow? A-B cutoff not working?
    - 4Q3/7P/8/8/8/2k3PK/8/3q4 w KQkq - 1 2
- Set up more robust testing of time.
    - Able to play without randomness.
    - Test how long it takes to play a game. Perhaps start part-way through.
- Add iterative deepening.
- Sort promotions higher.
