- Add iterative deepening.
    - If interrupted search found a result and it's greater than previous alpha, pick it.
- Modify UCI to be multi-threaded.
    - Pass along info as it's happening.
    - Allow stop command.
- Look through saved screenshots, make FEN regression tests for each.
    - Really slow end-of-game when mate is in sight. Why is it so slow? A-B cutoff not working?
    - 4Q3/7P/8/8/8/2k3PK/8/3q4 w KQkq - 1 2
