- Find way to play different versions against one another.
    - Given two git revisions (tags, etc.):
        - Also support "current" to mean the normal tree.
        - Clean out tmp directory.
        - For each:
            - git clone $HOME/teamten.
            - git checkout REF
            - ant
            - Run chessuci script, connecting to stdin and stdout.
        - Play N games.
            - Alternate moves.
            - Use movetime to set time limit.
            - Keep track of game state.
            - Save everything in log as games play.
        - Write summary (wins, losses, draws).
- Log files clash.
    - Log everything to a single file? 
    - Different files by timestamp and PID?
- Modify UCI to be multi-threaded.
    - Pass along info as it's happening.
    - Allow stop command.
- Add iterative deepening.
    - Support movetime parameter of go command.
- Look through saved screenshots, make FEN regression tests for each.
    - Really slow end-of-game when mate is in sight. Why is it so slow? A-B cutoff not working?
    - 4Q3/7P/8/8/8/2k3PK/8/3q4 w KQkq - 1 2
- Set up more robust testing of time.
    - Able to play without randomness.
    - Test how long it takes to play a game. Perhaps start part-way through.
