- Multiplying velocity times 0.90 means it sometimes never stops (try manually).
- Reducing that to 0.49 means that the search sometimes just hovers.
- Once saw it hovering with 0.90 too. Too short a search?
- Time the search. If it's small, replace 100 limit with a time limit, maybe 40 ms.
- Consider writing our own priority queue that's also a hash table.
